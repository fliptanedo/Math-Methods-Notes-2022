# Math-Methods-Notes-2022
Lecture notes for a graduate mathematical methods in physics course at UCR

These notes replace the [2021 version](https://github.com/fliptanedo/Math-Methods-Notes-2021). 
While I am rewriting these, the 2021 version may have information that has not been ported to this version.
